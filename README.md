# Understanding the Influence of Qubit Features on Error Rates
This is a description of fa23 research conducted under Dr. Nicholas LaRacuente on the analysis of aspects of qubit calibration data and the correlation to its gate error rates.

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to assess correlations between qubit features and ultimately predict error probability. In a quantum computer, quantum bits are used to process information, similar to how classical computers use bits to store and process information in series of 1s and 0s. Quantum gates are used to manipulate qubit states. They are analogus to classical logic gates like NOT, OR, etc. I conducted time series analysis for 7-qubit
